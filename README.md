# Degusta Box
####Tech challenge
### To build project run:
``make start``

### To up project:
``make up``

### To stop project:
``make stop``

### To erase project:
``make erase``

## Workflow:

When running up project client built project will be available in http://localhost:8081, access it to find the UI.

The development server will be in http://localhost:8100, there livereloading allows to see changes to client project inmediately.

!!!Note: The development client UI may take a while in being accessible. You can check ionic container log to see when livereload is ready.

The api server lives in http://localhost:8080

## Unit testing
No unit tests have been implemented as entities are very simple with no logic.

Other kind of testing has not been considered necessary for this exercise.
